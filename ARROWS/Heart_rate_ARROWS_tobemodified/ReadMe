ST 2018-12-17 adapted from HANDS experiment

The scripts in this folder do the following:
- PgDataARROWS.R: Reads pulse gating logfiles, retains only participants that can be included, and writes a file called PgDataARROWS.csv.
- SessionInfo.R: Reads PgDataARROWS.csv and adds information about session and sleep condition. Writes PgDataARROWSSessionInfo.csv.
- PgDataARROWSTime.R: Reads PgDataARROWSSessionInfo.csv, determines heart rate along the time course, and writes a file called PgDataARROWSTime.csv.
- OnsetTimes.R: Reads presentation logfiles, finds stimulus onset times, cuts out data from a window around the onset times, and writes to a file for each participant in the folder PgDataARROWSStimulus.
- CheckDataForArtifacts.R: Reads participant data from PgDataHandsStimulus and plots them around each stimulus, to allow for manual checking of artifacts.
- CorrectData.R: Goes over each participant and removes data where the heart rate is apparently too low or too high. Sandra has made this assessment for each participant. Also removed events where > 50 % of the baseline (i.e. 5 s before stimulus onset) is missing, or where Sandra has determined that the whole recording has too poor quality. Writes corrected data to folder PgDataHandsStimulusCorrected.
- NormaliseValues.R: Reads corrected data and normalises heart rate to 5 s window before stimulus onset within each stimulus category. Plots results.
- Heart-rate.R: Reads corrected data from object SuperList, generated by OnsetTimes.R, and which must still be in environment, it seems. Normalises data, puts them in data frame, extracts mean values by event, and plots results by condition.
- PlotData.R: Reads mean responses for pain and no pain event for each participant and plots time courses.
- MEModel.R: Written by GN today. Reads corrected data, normalises them for each individual response, plots them, generates a mean for each response, and analyses data with mixed-effects modelling.
