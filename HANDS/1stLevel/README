These scripts were written by Sandra Tamm.

Three different 1st-level analysis scripts were used:
- 1st_level_combined_160304_job.m:      Models the two sessions as within-subjects and includes only those participants that have data from both sessions.
- first_level_150320_job.m:             Models all sessions as independent and includes every session for which data were available and could be included.
- first_level_Modulated_1506232_job.m:  Models all sessions as independent and includes rated unpleasantness as a parametric modulator

Two scripts were used to read Presentation logfiles and create Matlab objects with event onsets and durations:
- ScriptToGetOnsetsHANDS_150319.m:            Without parametric modulator
- ScriptToGetOnsetsHANDS_modulated_150623.m:  WIth rated unpleasantness as parametric modulator
