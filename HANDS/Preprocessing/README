The scripts in this folder were written by Sandra Tamm.

They are batch sripts for preprocessing in SPM12. In most cases, the scripts call files from a folder tree without specifying participants id:s. In cases where participants' files were called by id:s, these have been redacted to preserve anonymity.

Order of preprocessing:
- Slice time correction
- Realignment
- Coregistration
- DARTEL segmentation
- Normalisation and smoothing

Images were manually realigned before normalisation.
