ICA network connectivity results were analysed in SPM12 to compare sleep conditions and age groups. This folder contains the batch scripts for these analyses. Results were investigated using both a gray matter mask ("gm") and network-specific masks ("masked"). For some reason, the batch script for network 10, masked, was not saved, but it followed the same principle as the other scripts.
