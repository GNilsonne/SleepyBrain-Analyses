ICA network connectivity results were analysed in SPM12 to compare sleep conditions and age groups. 
This folder contains batch scripts, SPM objects, and results files for these analyses. 
T maps, beta maps, and contrast maps are not included on account of their large sizes.
Results were investigated using both network-specific masks ("masked") and a gray matter mask ("gm"). 
T maps for the young-old and old-young contrasts (masked) will be posted on NeuroVault.
