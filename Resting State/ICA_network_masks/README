Network masks were generated using the imcalc function in SPM12, based on the parcellation in:
Shirer, W.R., Ryali, S., Rykhlevskaia, E., Menon, V., Greicius, M.D., 2012. Decoding Subject-Driven Cognitive States with Whole-Brain Connectivity Patterns. Cereb Cortex 22, 158â€“165. doi:10.1093/cercor/bhr099

The files in this folder contain SPM batch scripts showing which components were joined into which network masks.
