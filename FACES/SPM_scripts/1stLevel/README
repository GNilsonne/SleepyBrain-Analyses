This folder contains scripts to generate event onset files and perform 1st level analyses. In the "Preprocessing" subfolder, there is a master file ("run_analyses.m") that calls these scripts. Scripts were written by dr Colin Hawco, except the script to get event onsets, which was written by Gustav Nilsonne and adapted by Colin Hawco.
The scripts are:
- get_sleep_faces_events.m: generates event files
- sleep_faces_glm.m:        performs 1st-level analyses
- sleep_faces_glm_pmod.m:   performs 1st-level analyses with parametric modulators to investigate habituation/sensitization
