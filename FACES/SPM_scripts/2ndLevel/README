This folder contains scripts to generate event onset files and perform 1st level analyses. In the "Preprocessing" subfolder, there is a master file ("run_analyses.m") that calls these scripts. Scripts were written by dr Colin Hawco.
The scripts are:
- sleep_group_test.m:       One-sample t-tests for 1st-level contrasts, separately for each condition (sleep deprived and not sleep deprived)
- sleep_group_sesstest.m:   Paired t-test for differeces between sleep deprived and full sleep conditions. 
- sleep_group_agetest.m:    Independent-samples t-test for younger vs older participants, separately for each condition
- sleep_group_Ftest.m:      Flexible factorial F-test for group by condition analysis
- sleep_rois_mpfc.m:        Extracts data from mPFC ROI for PPI analysis (ROI can be found on NeuroVault: http://neurovault.org/collections/RLWUZRQN)
- sleep_FFA_rois.m:         Extracts data from FFA ROI for PPI analysis (ROI:s can be found on NeuroVault: http://neurovault.org/collections/RLWUZRQN)
- sleep_amyg_rois.m:        Extracts data from amygdala ROI for PPI analysis (ROI:s can be found on NeuroVault: http://neurovault.org/collections/RLWUZRQN)
- sleep_group_test_PPI.m:   Performs PPI analyses
- sleep_MPFC_PPI.m:         Analyses functional connectivity from mPFC
- sleep_faces_glm_pmod.m:   Analyses habituation/sensitization (parametric modulation by time)
- sleep_group_test_pmod.m:  Analyses differences between groups in habituation/sensitization
