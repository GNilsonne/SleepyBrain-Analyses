Folders contain SPM.mat files for various analyses. The folders are as follows:
- group_age11: Results from the younger group in the full sleep condition only (verify!)
- group_age12: Results from the older group in the full sleep condition only (verify!)
- group_ses1: Results from the full sleep condition only (verify!)
- group_ses2: Results from the sleep deprived condition only (verify!)

In the folders are results for the following contrasts: 
- AN: Angry stimuli vs implicit baseline
- AN_NE: Angry stimuli versus neutral stimuli
- HA: Happy stimuli versus neutral stimuli
- HA_NE: Happy stimuli versus neutral stimuli
- HA_AN: Happy stimuli versus angry stimuli
- HA+AN: Happy and angry stimuli versus implicit baseline (verify!)
- HA+AN+NE: Happy, angry, and neutral stimuli versus implicit baseline
