GN 2015-12-17
ST 2018-08-17 adapted from HANDS experiment for FACES

The scripts in this folder do the following:
- PgDataFACES.R: Reads pulse gating logfiles, retains only participants that can be included, and writes a file called PgDataFACES.csv.
- SessionInfo.R: Reads PgDataFACES.csv and adds information about session and sleep condition. Writes PgDataFACESSessionInfo.csv.
- PgDataFACESTime.R: Reads PgDataFACESSessionInfo.csv, determines heart rate along the time course, and writes a file called PgDataFACESTime.csv.
- OnsetTimes.R: Reads presentation logfiles, finds stimulus onset times, cuts out data from a window around the onset times, and writes to a file for each participant in the folder PgDataFACESStimulus.

- CheckDataForArtifacts.R: Reads participant data from PgDataARROWSStimulus and plots them around each stimulus, to allow for manual checking of artifacts.
- CorrectData.R: Goes over each participant and removes data where the heart rate is apparently too low or too high. Also removes blocks where > 50 % of data is missing. Check error messages


- MEModel.R: Written by GN today. Reads corrected data, normalises them for each individual response, plots them, generates a mean for each response, and analyses data with mixed-effects modelling.
